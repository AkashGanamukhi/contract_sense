Smart Contract Manager – Replit Project Prompt
1. Core Workflow

User uploads a PDF/DOCX contract.

Extract and display the contract text in a scrollable document viewer with syntax highlighting.

Send the contract text to the Gemini API (placeholder GEMINI_API_KEY).

Gemini returns:

Flagged risky clauses with explanations.

Risk score (0–100) for the entire contract.

Missing protections (e.g., liability cap, termination rights, confidentiality).

Suggested alternative clauses for balance.

Plain-language summary of key risks.

2. User Interface (SaaS-Style)

Dashboard layout:

Left panel → Contract viewer with highlighted risky clauses.

Right panel → Risk insights, filters, and charts.

Clause Explorer: Clickable table of contents tagged with risk levels.

Highlighting system:

🔴 Red = High risk

🟡 Yellow = Medium risk

🟢 Green = Acceptable clause

Tooltips: Hover → risk explanation & suggestions.

Search/Filter: Keyword search across the contract.

Responsive UI: Works on both desktop & mobile.

3. Advanced Features (Legal AI Essentials)

Clause Comparison: Show Gemini’s safer alternatives right under flagged clauses.

Negotiation Playbook Upload: User uploads JSON/CSV with preferred terms → Gemini customizes risk checks accordingly.

Version Comparison (Redlining): Upload two contracts → highlight changes + risks introduced.

Risk Heatmap Visualization: Pie chart / radar chart of risks by category (Termination, Liability, Confidentiality, Payment).

Toggle Views: Plain English explanations ↔ Detailed Legal View.

Collaboration:

Add inline comments on clauses.

Share analysis via secure link (frontend-only).

Smart Alerts: Show missing protections + suggest sample clauses.

Export Options: Analysis as PDF, Word, or JSON.

Integrations (mock): Buttons for Google Drive, Dropbox, Notion.

Confidence Scores: Show Gemini’s confidence level on each risk finding.

4. Extra Real-World Features (High-Value)

Auto-Risk Benchmarking: Compare contract’s risk score vs. industry average (using Gemini prompt).

Clause Library: Users can save their own approved clauses and insert them into new contracts.

Deal-Type Templates: Choose “Employment Agreement,” “NDA,” “Vendor Contract” → Gemini applies specialized risk checks.

Jurisdiction Awareness: User selects country/state → Gemini adjusts analysis to local laws (simulation).

Obligation Tracker: Extract deadlines, renewal dates, notice periods → display timeline/calendar view.

Quick Q&A Mode: Chatbox → “Does this contract allow auto-renewal?” or “What’s the liability cap?” → Gemini answers directly.

Summary Dashboard: For uploaded contracts → show portfolio view with aggregated risk scores.

Explainability Mode: Show why Gemini flagged something → highlight clause patterns it detected.

Accessibility: Copy-to-clipboard buttons for risks, summaries, and clauses.

5. UX & Design

Clean legal-tech aesthetic: white background, blue/gray palette, card-based UI.

Smooth animations: Highlight transitions, collapsible panels, chart animations.

Loading states: Show spinner + “Analyzing contract with Gemini…” message.

Dark mode toggle.

Quick copy buttons for flagged risks, summaries, and alternative clauses.

6. Frontend-Only Constraint

✅ No backend logic.

✅ All analysis via Gemini API fetch calls.

✅ Use placeholder GEMINI_API_KEY in code.

✅ Modular API calls → easily swappable for real backend later.
